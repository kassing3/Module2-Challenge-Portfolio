# Module2-Challenge-Portfolio

## Description

This purpose of this project is to create a portfolio application from scratch for potential employers to review samples of my work and assess my skills.

To ensure that my portfolio satisfies employers' needs, I followed the following acceptance criteria:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

When beginning this project, I performed a Crazy 8s exercise, and used wireframes to help me visualize my design before I began to code. This step saved me time in my planning and execution phases by preventing me from getting caught in the details and explore as many ideas as possible. I also found that this step in designing to be one of my favorite steps in web development.

When I began coding, the trickiest parts were creating the hamburger menu, and laying out elements in a way that will be responsive and cohesive. I was able to put together the code for the hamburger menu after following [Code Boxx's 3 Steps Simple Responsive Hamburger Menu In Pure CSS by W.S. Toh ](https://code-boxx.com/simple-responsive-pure-css-hamburger-menu/). This method used a checkbox input and display properties to toggle between the navigation items in the hamburger menu. I used this hamburger menu in my responsive design, because I noticed as the screen decreased in size, the navigation looked busy. 

When working towards responsive design, the use of media queries were helpful when changing elements after certain breakpoints. Also the use of flexbox and grids, helped in laying out the elements effectively throughout the design.

From this project, I learned the importance of starting simple, and building up to complex coding only when necessary. I also learned that CSS is a very powerful tool when styling your web application and making them responsive. I also receive a better understanding on why UX Design is important when building web applications as it's important to keep the user in my mind as you code and design web applications.

When using the hamburger menu, you must click on the icon to toggle in and out of the navigation bar.

## Credits

I would like to give a special thanks to my Tutors and TAs for their guidance and wisdom  throughout working on this project. I've gained a better understanding of concepts such as flexbox, grid, and responsive design from our sessions. I would also like to give credit to Code Boxx for their helpful tutorial on creating a hamburger menu with only HTML and CSS.
