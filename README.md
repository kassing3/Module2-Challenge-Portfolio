## Description

This purpose of this project is to create a portfolio application from scratch for potential employers to review samples of my work and assess my skills.

To ensure that my portfolio satisfies employers' needs, I followed the following acceptance criteria:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

When beginning this project, I performed a Crazy 8s exercise, and used wireframes to help me visualize my design before I began to code. This step saved me time in my planning and execution phases by preventing me from getting caught in the details and explore as many ideas as possible. I also found that this step in designing to be one of my favorite steps in web development. When working towards responsive design, the use of media queries and Bootstrap were helpful when changing elements after certain breakpoints. Also the use of flexbox and grids, helped in laying out the elements effectively throughout the design.
